## Requirements

* <b>Kotlin</b> - 1.3.50

## Technology and Functionality Overview

The app is built in <strong>MVVM</strong> design pattern, writen solely in <strong>Kotlin</strong>. For concurrency and reactive programming tools I decided to go with <strong>LiveData</strong> and <strong>Coroutines</strong>. The app fetches the data from the network using <strong>Retrofit2</strong>, then stores it locally with help of <strong>Room</strong> library. It uses <strong>Kodein</strong> for dependency injection.

<p><h3 align="center">Main Objectives</h3></p>
‚úÖ <em>"There should be two tabs in the app, preferably put in the form of bottom navigation."</em><br> <strong> ‚Ä¢ BottomNavigationView</strong> and <strong>Navigation Component</strong> (Android Jetpack). <br><br>
‚úÖ <em>"Events screen should present a list of events available to be watched. When an item is tapped, the appropriate video is played on Playback Screen."</em> <br> <strong> ‚Ä¢ RecyclerView</strong>. <br><br>
‚úÖ <em>"Use the standard APIs to present a list of items provided by our API."</em> <br> <strong> ‚Ä¢ Retrofit2</strong>. <br><br>
‚úÖ‚ùì <em>"Assume that the list can get fairly long (e.g up to 100 items)."</em> <br> Data from the network is cached in db (<strong>Room</strong>), but it would be even better with <strong>Paging</strong> (network + cache), which I didn't manage to implement in time.<br><br>
‚úÖ <em>"Events should be ordered by date in ascending order. Extra points will be awarded for date formatting similar to the one presented in the mockups."</em> <br> <strong> ‚Ä¢ Java Time</strong>.<br><br>
‚úÖ <em>"Schedule screen, with a schedule for today only. It should auto-refresh every 30 seconds."</em> <br> Auto-refresh done with <strong> Coroutines</strong>.<br><br>
‚úÖ <em>"Extra points will be awarded for updating the state of the list without losing its scroll position and without flickering."</em> <br> <strong> ‚Ä¢ DiffUtil</strong>.<br><br>
‚úÖ <em>"Thumbnails should be retrieved from the listings feed."</em> <br> <strong> ‚Ä¢ Glide</strong>.<br><br>
‚úÖ <em>"Additionally, there should be a Playback Screen, playing a video in the default player. Use whichever player you prefer. The aim is to be able to play the video that is provided in the selected event."</em> <br> <strong> ‚Ä¢ ExoPlayer2</strong>.<br><br>
